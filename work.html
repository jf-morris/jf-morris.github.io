        <h2>Capacity Expansion Modeling</h2>
        <p>While advised by Dharik Mallapragada at MIT CEEPR and the MIT Energy Initiative from 2020 to 2022, I served on the development team for the capacity expansion model GenX. Features I contributed to include multi-stage modeling, time domain reduction, and technology retrofits.</p>

		<p>GenX is a highly-configurable, <a href="https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl">open-source</a> electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape.</p>
		<p>The model was originally developed by Jesse D. Jenkins and Nestor A. Sepulveda at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by a team of contributors at the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins), MIT (led by Ruaridh MacDonald), NYU (led by Dharik Mallapragada), and Binghamton University (led by Neha Patankar).</p>
		<p>GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.</p>

			<h3>Natural Gas in the U.S. Southeast Power Sector under Deep Decarbonization: Modeling Technology and Policy Sensitivities</h3>
			<p> 
			Concerns over climate change, along with falling costs of renewable energy technologies, have led to increased scrutiny over the role of natural gas in a low-carbon energy future. In this study, we use a multi-stage capacity expansion modeling framework to evaluate the role of natural gas-fired power plants (NG) in the evolving electrical grid of the U.S. Southeast. Under assumptions of perfect foresight and high electrification, our modeling considers cost-optimal grid operations, investments, and retirements through 2045 using a detailed representation of the U.S. Southeast’s electrical grid which includes inter-region transmission, variable renewable energy resource characteristics, brown field capacity, and lifetime and economic retirements. We explore the impact of key technology and policy sensitivities including three alternative CO2 emissions trajectories, technology costs, nuclear plant lifetime extensions, upstream methane emissions, and direct regulations of NG deployment and financing. In addition to the unprecedented deployments of variable renewable energy and battery storage necessary to decarbonize, we find that investments in NG are made across all scenarios evaluated. Results highlight the substantial emissions contributions of the existing coal fleet and the potential for emissions reductions if lower-carbon generation resources, including new NG with and without carbon capture and storage, can replace this capacity. Furthermore, emissions limits which require the lowest mid-century CO2 emissions do not necessarily lead to the greatest cumulative emissions reductions over the planning horizon. Finally, we observe that large differences in technology and policy conditions result in only modest changes in capacity deployments and the cost of the energy transition, allowing utilities and regulators to move forward with confidence under a strategy primarily characterized by phasing out coal generation and deploying new renewable energy. These results support nuanced approaches to resource planning for future low-carbon grids which consider both short-term and long-term trade-offs of cost and emissions reductions.

        <h2>Energy Data Visualization</h2>
		
		Modeling energy systems requires vast amounts of data relating to the generation, transmission, distribution, storage, and consumption of energy. This data often varies in time and space and is subject to great uncertainty. Explore a few data visualizations that I have produced while conducting my energy systems modeling research.
