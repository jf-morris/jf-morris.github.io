        <h2>Capacity Expansion Modeling</h2>
		
		<img src="projects/genx_logo.svg" alt="GenX.jl" class="svg-inline">
        <p>While advised by Dharik Mallapragada at MIT CEEPR and the MIT Energy Initiative from 2020 to 2022, I served on the development team for the capacity expansion model GenX. Features I contributed to include multi-stage modeling, time domain reduction, and technology retrofits.</p>
		<p>GenX is a highly-configurable, <a href="https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl">open-source</a> electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape.</p>
		<p>The model was originally developed by Jesse D. Jenkins and Nestor A. Sepulveda at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by a team of contributors at the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins), MIT (led by Ruaridh MacDonald), NYU (led by Dharik Mallapragada), and Binghamton University (led by Neha Patankar).</p>
		<p>GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.</p>

		<h3>Natural Gas in the U.S. Southeast Power Sector under Deep Decarbonization: Modeling Technology and Policy Sensitivities</h3>
		<div class="container">
		  <div class="description">
			<p> 
			Concerns over climate change, along with falling costs of renewable energy technologies, have led to increased scrutiny over the role of natural gas in a low-carbon energy future. In this study, we use a multi-stage capacity expansion modeling framework to evaluate the role of natural gas-fired power plants (NG) in the evolving electrical grid of the U.S. Southeast. Under assumptions of perfect foresight and high electrification, our modeling considers cost-optimal grid operations, investments, and retirements through 2045 using a detailed representation of the U.S. Southeast’s electrical grid which includes inter-region transmission, ....

		<h3>Retrofit Solutions to Electric Power Sector Decarbonization in the American Midwest</h3>
		<img src="projects/remastered-thesis-major-metrics.png" alt="thesis-major-metrics" class="png-inline">
		<p>	Electric power system decarbonization requires phasing out existing, carbon-emitting power plants and replacing them with new, clean generation and transmission capacity. This transition presents simultaneous challenges in investment and operational costs and system reliability. In hopes of saving costs, ensuring reliability, and preserving the power plant workforce, interest has risen among states and utilities in the potential of power plant retrofits. By reusing existing equipment and infrastructure in aging coal and natural gas power plants, utilities can save costs on new greenfield developments. Several developing technologies well-equipped to reuse all or part of the facilities at these thermal power plants include firm, low-carbon power plants and long-duration storage facilities. These technologies help balance load in a high renewables grid while employing much of the same power plant workforce. A study of retrofit options is particularly important for the American Midwest where coal makes up a large portion of the resource mix and where the potential for intermittent wind deployment is high. This thesis enables retrofit modeling in a multi-stage capacity expansion framework and uses it to evaluate the potential for retrofits to lower system costs and cumulative emissions over three modeled carbon reduction pathways from 2020 to 2040 in the Midwest and surrounding areas. Although resulting reductions in cost and emissions are modest, we observe notable system-level reductions in curtailment of renewable generation, transmission expansion, and new natural gas deployment as well as distributional impacts relating to the costs of transitioning to a low-carbon electric power system.</p>

        <h2>Energy Data Visualization</h2>
		
		Modeling energy systems requires vast amounts of data relating to the generation, transmission, distribution, storage, and consumption of energy. This data often varies in time and space and is subject to great uncertainty. Explore a few data visualizations that I have produced while conducting my energy systems modeling research.
