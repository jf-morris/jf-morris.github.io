        <h2>Capacity Expansion Modeling</h2>
        <p>While advised by Dharik Mallapragada at MIT CEEPR and the MIT Energy Initiative from 2020 to 2022, I served on the development team for the capacity expansion model GenX. Features I contributed to include multi-stage modeling, time domain reduction, and technology retrofits.</p>
		<p>GenX is a highly-configurable, <a href="https://github.com/GenXProject/GenX.jl">open-source</a> electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art practices in electricity system planning to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape.</p>
		<p>The model was originally developed by Jesse D. Jenkins and Nestor A. Sepulveda at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is now jointly maintained by a team of contributors at the Princeton University ZERO Lab (led by Jenkins), MIT (led by Ruaridh MacDonald), NYU (led by Dharik Mallapragada), and Binghamton University (led by Neha Patankar).</p>
		<p>GenX is a constrained linear or mixed integer linear optimization model that determines the portfolio of electricity generation, storage, transmission, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in one or more future planning years at lowest cost, while subject to a variety of power system operational constraints, resource availability limits, and other imposed environmental, market design, and policy constraints.</p>

        <h2>Energy Data Visualization</h2>
		
		Modeling energy systems requires vast amounts of data relating to the generation, transmission, distribution, storage, and consumption of energy. This data often varies in time and space and is subject to great uncertainty. Explore a few data visualizations that I have produced while conducting my energy systems modeling research.
